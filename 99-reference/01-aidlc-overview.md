# AI‑DLC Overview (Authoritative Reference)

## Purpose

This document is the canonical explanation of the **AI‑Driven Development Life Cycle (AI‑DLC)**. It defines *why* the framework exists, *what* problems it solves, and *how* it should be interpreted across all teams.

This file is **read‑only by intent** and must not be forked or reinterpreted at team level.

---

## Why AI‑DLC Exists

AI dramatically accelerates software delivery. However, acceleration without discipline introduces new systemic risks:

* Assumption‑driven requirements
* Overconfident design decisions
* Non‑auditable code generation
* Fragile systems delivered very quickly

AI‑DLC exists to ensure that **speed is earned, not assumed**.

> AI‑DLC does not slow teams down. It prevents teams from going fast in the wrong direction.

---

## What Makes AI‑DLC Different

| Traditional Model        | AI‑DLC Model                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Human‑centric execution  | AI‑assisted execution       |
| Trust by default         | Verify before execution     |
| Documents as by‑products | Documents as control points |
| Agile rituals            | Phase‑gated governance      |

AI‑DLC treats AI as a **high‑power industrial tool**, not a convenience feature.

---

## Core Design Philosophy

### 1. Structure Before Speed

AI is only allowed to execute after intent, scope, and risk are explicit.

### 2. Adaptive Depth

Not every change deserves heavyweight process. Depth scales with:

* Risk
* Scope
* Ambiguity

### 3. Overconfidence Prevention

When uncertainty exists, AI must pause and ask—not infer.

### 4. Auditability by Default

Every decision, question, and output is logged and traceable.

### 5. Resume‑Anytime Continuity

Work must survive interruptions, handovers, and team changes.

---

## The Three‑Phase Lifecycle

### 🔵 Inception — What to Build & Why

Focuses on intent clarity, risk awareness, and architectural direction.

### 🟢 Construction — How to Build It

Executes controlled, per‑unit design and code generation with validation.

### 🟡 Operations — How to Run It (Future‑Ready)

Planned expansion for deployment, observability, and production readiness.

---

## Definition of "Done" in AI‑DLC

A change is considered *done* only when:

* Intent is unambiguous
* Design is reviewed and approved
* Code is generated from an approved plan
* Tests provide evidence, not confidence
* State and audit logs are complete

Delivery without explainability is considered **incomplete**.

---

## Audience

This document applies to:

* Business Analysts
* Architects
* Developers
* QA
* Platform & Governance teams
* CXO reviewers

Any deviation requires formal exception handling.

---

## Authority

This document supersedes team‑level interpretations of AI‑DLC.
Changes require architectural governance approval.
