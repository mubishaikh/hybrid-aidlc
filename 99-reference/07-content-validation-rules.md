# Content Validation Rules — AI-DLC

## Purpose

This document defines **non-negotiable content validation rules** for all artifacts, code, and documentation produced under the AI-Driven Development Life Cycle (AI-DLC).

Its role is to ensure that:

* Outputs are **correct, complete, and context-aware**
* AI-generated content is **reviewable, defensible, and production-grade**
* Quality is validated through rules, not subjective confidence

In short: **no content moves forward unless it passes validation.**

---

## Core Validation Principle

> **Generation creates output. Validation creates trust.**

AI is permitted to generate content.
Only validated content is permitted to progress through phase gates.

---

## Validation Scope

These rules apply to:

* Requirements documentation
* Architecture and design artifacts
* Source code
* Test cases and test results
* Infrastructure definitions
* Operational documentation

No artifact is exempt.

---

## Universal Validation Rules (Apply to All Artifacts)

Every artifact must satisfy the following checks:

### 1. Completeness

* All required sections are present
* No placeholder text remains
* No TODOs without explicit approval

### 2. Consistency

* Terminology matches `requirements.md`
* Naming aligns across documents and code
* No conflicting statements between artifacts

### 3. Traceability

* Clearly linked to:

  * Requirement
  * User story (if applicable)
  * Unit of work
* Trace l
