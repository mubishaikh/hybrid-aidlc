# 10 – Collaboration Model (AI-DLC)

## Purpose

This document defines **how multiple humans and AI collaborate safely and efficiently** within AI-DLC, without relying on time-zone handoffs, heroics, or informal coordination.

In enterprise delivery language: this is the **operating rhythm** that makes AI-DLC usable at scale.

---

## Design Principles

The AI-DLC collaboration model is built on five non-negotiable principles:

1. **Artifact-first collaboration** – Work progresses through documents, not chats
2. **State-driven coordination** – `aidlc-state.md` is the single coordination mechanism
3. **Role-aligned interaction** – AI behavior adapts to the active role
4. **Asynchronous by default** – No dependency on real-time overlap
5. **Gate-based convergence** – Alignment happens at gates, not continuously

---

## Why Traditional Collaboration Fails with AI

Typical collaboration models assume:

* Sequential human work
* Informal clarifications
* Tacit knowledge transfer

AI breaks these assumptions by:

* Working continuously
* Generating artifacts faster than humans can react
* Appearing confident even when uncertain

AI-DLC solves this by **slowing decisions while accelerating execution**.

---

## Collaboration Layers

AI-DLC collaboration operates across four explicit layers:

### 1. Human ↔ AI Collaboration

* AI generates drafts, options, and risk signals
* Humans validate, approve, or reject
* AI never self-approves

Key Control:

* All questions captured in markdown files
* All decisions logged in `audit.md`

---

### 2. Role ↔ Role Collaboration
