# 15. Future Operations Roadmap

## Purpose

This document outlines the **future-state Operations roadmap** for the AI-Driven Development Life Cycle (AI-DLC).

While the current AI-DLC formally concludes at the end of the Construction Phase (Build & Test), this roadmap defines how AI-DLC evolves into a **run-the-business and change-the-business operating model**.

The intent is to ensure AI-DLC matures from a delivery accelerator into a **full enterprise software operating system**.

---

## Strategic Context

As AI-driven delivery becomes the norm rather than the exception, organizations must operationalize:

* Continuous deployment
* Continuous assurance
* Continuous compliance

The Operations Phase is designed to close this loop.

This roadmap is intentionally forward-looking and modular, allowing incremental adoption without disrupting current delivery maturity.

---

## Operations Design Principles

The future Operations Phase will be governed by the following principles:

* **Automation-first, human-controlled**
* **Observability by default**
* **Security and compliance embedded, not bolted on**
* **Operational readiness as a measurable outcome**
* **AI assistance with explicit human accountability**

---

## Target Operations Capabilities

### 1. Deployment Automation

Objective: Standardise and accelerate production releases with safety controls.

Planned capabilities:

* CI/CD pipeline templates aligned to AI-DLC units
* Environment promotion rules (Dev → Test → Prod)
* Automated rollback and blue/green deployment support
* Release approvals tied to phase gates

Key outcome:
Predictable, low-risk deployments at scale.

---

### 2. Monitoring and Observability

Objective: Make system health visible and actionable.

Planned capabilities:

* Standard logging, metrics, and tracing patterns
* Golden signals dashboards (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
* AI-assisted anomaly detection
* SLA and SLO tracking per Unit of Work

Key outcome:
Early detection replaces reactive firefighting.

---

### 3. Incident and Problem Management

Objective: Reduce mean time to detect (MTTD) and recover (MTTR).

Planned capabilities:

* Standard incident classification model
* Automated alert routing and escalation
* Runbooks generated from design artifacts
* Post-incident reviews with AI-assisted root cause analysis

Key outcome:
Operational learning becomes systematic, not anecdotal.

---

### 4. Production Readiness Validation

Objective: Prevent unsafe releases.

Planned capabilities:

* Production readiness checklists
* Security, performance, and resilience sign-offs
* Dependency and blast-radius analysis
* Go/No-Go decision framework

Key outcome:
No deployment without evidence-based confidence.

---

### 5. Security and Compliance Operations

Objective: Maintain continuous security posture.

Planned capabilities:

* Continuous vulnerability scanning
* Secrets and key rotation automation
* Compliance evidence generation (logs, approvals, test results)
* Policy-as-code integration

Key outcome:
Security becomes continuous assurance, not episodic review.

---

### 6. AI-in-Operations (AIOps)

Objective: Leverage AI safely in production environments.

Planned capabilities:

* AI-assisted log analysis and trend detection
* Predictive capacity and cost management
* Controlled AI recommendations for remediation
* Human approval loops for corrective actions

Key outcome:
AI augments operators without removing accountability.

---

## Operating Model Alignment

The future Operations Phase integrates with:

* SRE and DevOps practices
* ITSM and incident workflows
* Enterprise risk and compliance frameworks

AI-DLC does not replace these models.
It provides a **unifying execution and governance layer**.

---

## Phased Adoption Roadmap

### Phase A: Foundations

* Standard CI/CD templates
* Baseline monitoring and logging
* Production readiness checklist

### Phase B: Intelligence

* AI-assisted observability
* Automated incident correlation
* Predictive alerts

### Phase C: Optimization

* Self-healing patterns (with approval)
* Cost and capacity optimisation
* Continuous compliance reporting

---

## Governance and Control

All Operations capabilities will:

* Be gated through explicit approvals
* Maintain audit trails
* Respect role boundaries
* Support exception handling mechanisms

Operations acceleration must never bypass governance.

---

## Success Metrics

Future Operations maturity will be measured through:

* Deployment frequency and failure rates
* MTTR and incident recurrence
* Compliance audit effort reduction
* Operational cost efficiency

What gets measured gets trusted.

---

## Executive Summary

The Operations Phase is the **natural next evolution** of AI-DLC.

It transforms AI-DLC from a delivery framework into an **enterprise-grade software lifecycle system**.

Fast delivery creates value.

Sustainable, observable, and governable delivery protects it.
